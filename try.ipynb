The mortgage value is printed on each Title \\nDeed card. \\nNo rent can be collected on mortgaged properties or utilities, \\nbut rent can be collected on unmortgaged properties in the \\nsame group. \\nIn order to lift the mortgage, the owner must pay the Bank the \\namount of the mortgage plus 10% interest. When all the propert~es of \\na color-group are no longer mortgaged, the owner may begin to buy \\nback houses at full price. \\nThe player who mortgages property retains possession of it and \\nno other player may secure it by lifting the mortgage from the Bank. \\nHowever, the owner may sell this mortgaged property to another player \\nat any agreed price. If you are the new owner, you may lift the mortgage \\nat once if you wish by paying off the mortgage plus \\n10% interest to the Bank. If the mortgage is not lifted \\nat once, you must pay the Bank 10% interest when \\nyou buy the property and if you lift the \\nmortgage later you must pay the Bank \\nan additional 10% interest as well \\nas the amount of the mortgage. \\nn ', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",
