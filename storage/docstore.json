Choose to play by \nthe classic rules for buying, renting and selling properties or use the \nSpeed Die to get into the action faster. If you've never played the classic \nMONOPOLY game, refer to the Classic Rules beginning on the next page. \nIf you already know how to play and want to use the Speed Die, just \nread the section below for the additional Speed Die rules. \nSPEED DIE RULES \nLearnins how to Play with the S~eed Die IS as \n/ \nfast as playing with i't. \n1. When starting the game, hand out an extra $1,000 to each player \n(two $5005 should work). The game moves fast and you'll need \nthe extra cash to buy and build. \n2. Do not use the Speed Die until you've landed on or passed over \nGO for the first time. Once you collect that first $200 salary, you'll \nuse the Speed Die for the rest of the game. This means that some \nplayers will start using the die before others. \n3. Once you start using the Speed Die, roll it along with the two \nwhite dice on your turn. Then do the following depending on \nwhat you rolled. \n1, 2, or 3: Add this number to the roll of the two white \ndice. You'll zoom around the board. Bus: This lets you \"get off the bus early.\" Look at the two white \ndice. You can move the value of one die, the other die, or the \nsum of both dice. So if you rolled a 1 and a 5, you can move \n1 space, 5 spaces, or 6 spaces: \\t's your choice. \nMr. Monopoly: First, move the sum of the two white dice \nand resolve the space you land on (such as drawing a card, \nbuying the property, paying rent, etc.). Then, one of two \nthings will happen depending on whether or not there is still \nproperty in the bank. \nYES, there is property in the bank -Advance to the NEXT \nproperty that the bank still holds and buy it if you wish. If you \ndon't want to buy this property, move to the space anyway \nand put the property up for auction. \nNO, there are no more properties in the bank - Advance to the \nNOCT property on which you will owe another player money. \nA few minor details: \nOnly the white dice are used when determining if you rolled doubles. \nDo not look at the Speed Die. \nIf you roll a three-of-a-kind (all of the dice show the same number), \nyou can move anywhere you want on the board! \nIf you get sent to jail during your move (either by landing on the \"Go \nto Jail\" space or by rolling doubles three times in a row) then your turn \nis over and you do not get to use the Speed Die for that turn. \nUse the white dice ONLY when rolling to get out of jail. \nL \nUse the sum of all three dice when determining how much to pay on \na utility. Note: The Bus and Mr. Monopoly are valued at 0. \nCLASSIC MONOPOW RULES \nOBJECT: The object of the game IS to become the \nwealthiest player through buying, renting and selling \nproperty. \nPREPARATION: Place the board on a table and put \nthe Chance and Community Chest cards facedown on \ntheir allotted spaces on the board.

When more than \nf~ve persons play, the Banker may elect to act only \nas Banker and Auctioneer. \nTHE BANK: Besides the Bank's money, the Bank \nholds the Title Deed cards and houses and hotels prior to purchase \nand use by the players. The Bank pays salaries and bonuses. It sells \nand auctions properties and hands out the~r proper Title Deed cards; \nit sells houses and hotels to the players and loans money when \nrequired on mortgages. \nThe Bank collects all taxes, fines, loans and interest, and the price of \nall properties which it sells and auctions. \nThe Bank nwer \"goes broke.\" If the Bank runs out of money, the Banker \nmay issue as much more as needed by writing on any ordinary paper. \nTHE PLAY: Starting with the Banker, each player in turn throws the dice. \nThe player with the highest total starts the play: Place your \ntoken on the corner marked \"GO,\" throw the dice and move \nyour token in the direction of the arrow the number of \nspaces indicated by the dice. After you have completed \nyour play, the turn passes to the left. The tokens remain \non the spaces qccupied and proceed from that point on \nthe player's next turn. Two or more tokens may rest on the \nsame space at the same time. \nAccording to the space your token reaches, you may be entitled to \nbuy real estate or other properties - or obliged to pay rent, pay taxes, \ndraw a Chance or Community Chest card, \"Go to Jail,\" etc. \nIf you throw doubles, you move your token as usual, the sum of the \ntwo dice, and are subject to any privileges or penalties pertaining to \nthe space on which you land. Retaining the dice, throw again and move \nyour token as before. If you throw doubles three times in succession, \nmove your token immediately to the space marked \"In Jail\" (see JAIL). \"GO\": Each time a player's token lands on or passes over \nGO, whether by throwing the dice or drawing a card, \nthe Banker pays himther a $200 sala,ry. \nThe $200 is paid only once each time kound \nthe board. However, if a player passing GO on \nthe throw of the dice lands 2 spaces beyond it \non Community Chest, or 7 spaces beyond \nit on Chance, and draws the \"Advance to GO\" card, helshe collects \n$200 for passing GO the first time and another $200 for reaching it the \nsecond time by instructions on the card. \nBUYING PROPERTY: Whenever you land on an unowned property you \nmay buy that property from the Bank at its printed price.

But \nyou must build evenly, i.e., you cannot erect more than one house on \nany one property of any color-group until you have built one house on \nwery property of that group. You may then begin on the second row \nof houses, and so on, up to a limit of four houses to a property. For \nexample, you cannot build three houses on one property if you have \nonly one house on another property of that group. \nAs you build evenly, you must also break down evenly ifyou sell \nhouses back to the Bank (see SELLING PROPERTY). \nHOTELS: When a player has four houses on each property of a \ncomplete color-group, hdshe may buy a hotel from the Bank and erect \nit on any property of the color-group.

If there are a limited number of \nhouses and hotels available and two or more players wish to buy more \nthan the Bank has, the houses or hotels must be sold at auction to the \nhighest bidder. SELLING PROPERN: Unimproved properties, railroads and util~ties \n(but not buildings) may be sold to any player as a private transaction \nfor any amount the owner can get; however, no property can be sold to \n- \nanother player if buildings are standing on any properties of that color- \ngroup.

Before an improved property can be mortgaged, all \nthe buildings on all the properties of its color-group must be sold back \nto the Bank at half price. The mortgage value is printed on each Title \nDeed card. \nNo rent can be collected on mortgaged properties or utilities, \nbut rent can be collected on unmortgaged properties in the \nsame group. \nIn order to lift the mortgage, the owner must pay the Bank the \namount of the mortgage plus 10% interest.

The new owner who does this may then, at hislher option, \npay the principal or hold the property until some later turn, then lift the \nmortgage. If helshe holds property in this way until a later turn, helshe \nmust pay the interest again upon lifting the mortgage. \nShould you owe the Bank, instead of another player, more than you \ncan pay (because of taxes or penalties) even by selling off buildings \nand mortgaging property, you must turn over all assets to the Bank. In \nthis case, the Bank immediately sells by auction all property so taken, \nexcept buildings. A bankrupt player must immediately retire from the \ngame. The last player left in the game wins. \nMISCEUANEOUS: Money can be loaned to a player only by the Bank \nand then only by mortgaging property. No player may borrow from or \nlend money to another player. \nL \nWe will be happy to hear your questions or comments about this game. Write to: Hasbro \nGames, Consumer Affairs Dept., P.O.
